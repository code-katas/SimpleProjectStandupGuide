# SimpleProjectStandupGuide
Short and sweet guides on creating new projects for various languages.

Ideally there will be the bare minimum for each language/project type, with some minor additions for more advanced standup or best-practices (ie. unit tests). These will provide a quick "how-to" when starting a new project in a language you don't use regularly.
